No mobile apps currently exist. Feel free to make experimental mobile apps in the Experiments repository where you have more permissive permissions to push code. If you are successful in creating a reliable and maintainable mobile app, then you can consider bringing it into here to be the first mobile app Picocrypt has ever had. You will need three approvals for your PR before you can push code here, though, so make sure to organize and stabilize your code for production before attempting to bring it into this repository. Good luck!
